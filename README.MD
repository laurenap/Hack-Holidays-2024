# 🎄 Hack-Holidays: 7-Day Hardware Challenge 🎄

Welcome to my **7-Day Hardware Challenge** where I'll be building simple projects using the **Super Uno R3 Starter Kit**. The goal is to learn, share, and showcase progress in **hardware hacking** as I connect my interests in neurotech, biotech, and hardware.

I’ll be **building in public** and posting daily updates on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/laurenap_) – follow along! 🚀

## 📅 Challenge Overview

Each day, I'll complete a small hardware project, documenting:
- Goals for the day
- Components used
- Arduino code
- Photos/videos of the project in action
- Reflections on what I learned or struggled with
